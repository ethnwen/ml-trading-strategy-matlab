# Machine Learning Trading Strategy in MATLAB

This project explores whether short-term stock returns can be predicted using machine learning models trained on technical indicators. A regression ensemble model is trained on historical stock price data and used to generate trading signals, which are then backtested and compared against a buy-and-hold strategy.
