## Abstract
This project investigates the use of machine learning models to predict short-term stock returns using technical indicators derived from historical price data.

## Methods
A regression ensemble model is trained in MATLAB using moving averages, momentum, and volatility as features. The model is evaluated through a backtesting framework.

## Conclusion
While predictive performance varies, the project demonstrates how machine learning and finance can be combined for quantitative modeling and strategy evaluation.
